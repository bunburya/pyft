# Configuring Shyft

You can configure certain aspects of {APP_NAME}'s behaviour on the [Configuration](/config) page. This page will explain
some of the configuration options and what they do.

## Matching thresholds

When you upload an activity, {APP_NAME} will try to identify existing activities of the same type that involve a similar
route, so you can compare this activity against other similar activities and track your progress on that route over
time.
